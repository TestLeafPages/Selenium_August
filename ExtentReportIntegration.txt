Extent Report Integration:
====================

Step1: Create a method startReport() and have the report level set up code inside method

Step2: Declare the variables for ExtentHtmlReporter and ExtentReports as global with public static

Step3: apply @BeforeSuite for the startReport() method

Step4: Create endReport() method to call extent.flush() and apply @AfterSuite

Step5: Create testCaseDetails() method and include the test creation, author and category setup codes.Apply the @BeforeClass annotation

Step6: Declare the ExtentTest globally with public static

Step7: Create global variavles for test case name, description, author and category

Step8: Replace the hardcoded values with the variable names in testCaseDetails() method

Step9: Assign the values for the test case name, description, author and category in each test cases at the @BeforeTest method (setDetails)

Step10: Create reportStep() with 2 args (msg and status). Call pass() / fail() based on the status


Step11: Surround each step code with try / catch block. Call reportStep with status as pass from try block and call reportStep with status as fail from the catch block


Step12: Create node for the test at the @BeforeMethod and declare the node globally

Step13: Make step level pass / fail to the node
